To utilize Pong.py, you can either open a terminal window and execute the program as you would any other
Python script, or you can simply open the file using your IDE of choice and run it there. I would recommend
PyCharm, because Turtle graphics works best here.

Once you are running the script, you can control the top platform horizontally using the “A” and “D” keys
and you can control the bottom platform using the left and right arrow keys. The program terminates once
one of the players reaches 10 points. 

Have fun!
